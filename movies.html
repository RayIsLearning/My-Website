               This was the first film I have seen in the cinema since 2019! I was very glad that I brought my daughter to see it because the Gospel was portrayed in a way that is easily digestible for children. The cinematography and storytelling were masterfully done!

                 This is one of those movies that I can watch repeatedly, and it never gets old. The story is about a young man with a mental handicap and big dreams of wrestling, a social worker who doesn't want to give him a chance, and a wayward criminal. They all intersect to tell an inspiring story of freedom.

                I admire the Ip Man movie franchise because of the skillful action sequences and historical storytelling that never gets dull. Donnie Yen and Michelle Yeoh always put on a dazzling display of martial arts while also being great actors.
