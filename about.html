                My family, faith, and creative pursuits motivate me to continuously improve myself. My unwavering commitment to lifelong growth, integrity, and empathy is non-negotiable. My creative skills make the world a better place through music, sculpture, and computer software. I enjoy web design and coding in JavaScript, C++, Python, and Java. While driven for great outcomes, my greatest treasure is time with my family. My long-term goals are to be remembered as a good father and to help others achieve their full potential.
